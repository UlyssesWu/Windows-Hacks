To Do List:

BUGS TO FIX:
 - Wavy
	- sometimes it gets cut off at the bottom
	- the issue is intermittent
	- it must be something to do with how the underlying WinAPI works
	- I suspect that slowing down how the calls are made could solve this
	- put System.Threading.Thread.Sleep(x) between every line of code in the method
	- see if it solves the issue then isolate the two lines that are the problem
 - Show
	- showing a window after it has been hidden changes its size
	- the new size is set to (0, 0)
	- this has something to do with how the WindowsAPI works (or the wrapper)
	- maybe save the dimensions before hiding it
	- then when you "show" it, resize it to the dimensions that it was originally
 - Masking the Desktop
	- sometimes putting the mask over the entire Desktop doesn't work right
	- it only masks over a small portion of the desktop, not the whole thing
	- example: the mouse spam may not take up the entire desktop
	- intermittent

TESTS TO MAKE:
 - Test on other versions of Windows
	- so far its only been tested on Windows 7
 - Will some of the features break on dual monitors?
	- the program assumes the Desktop is rectangular
	- having two monitors of different sizes could mean two rectangles
	- what would happen?

IMPROVEMENTS TO MAKE:
 - Write to Desktop
	- allow user to pick where to write to (a coordinate)
	- allow user to select the font size
	- allow user to select the color
 - Consider adding a Hotkey to quit the program
	- some of the "hacks" take too long and I want to be able to quit them
	- some features like Mouse Spam Extreme make it difficult to exit manually
 - Add command line parameters
	- this way you can run a feature of the program when it starts up
	- easier to prank people
 	- Example: windowshacks.exe 17 "Calculator" 300 300
	- The above line should resize the calculator to 300x300:

FEATURES TO ADD:
 - Mouse Velocity (physics)
	- use a while loop to keep track of how the mouse is being moved
	- calculate the vector between the two most recent points
	- this now becomes the velocity of the mouse
	- the mouse will now move based on the applied force
	- if it hits a Desktop border it should bounce
 - Window Velocity (physics)
	- same as Mouse Velocity but for a Window
 - Make a Window run away from the mouse
	- calculate the euclidean distance of a window and the mouse
	- if distance is smaller than a hardcoded value, move the Window away
 - Make a Window circle the Mouse indefinitely
	- this would be hilarious
 - Broken Screen
 	- Make certain areas on the screen darker than others
	- use a mask that goes ontop of the entire desktop
	- make sure it has mouse transparency
	- have cluster of bright and dark pixels with transparency
 - Fake Blue Screen of Death
	- this is easy to do with a mask
 - Stop Sign
	- make an image of a Stop Sign to follow wherever the mouse goes
	- it will be set to be "always on top"
	- therefore it will always be the top Window and directly under the mouse
  	- it will prevent the mouse from clicking anything
	- this would be hilarious
